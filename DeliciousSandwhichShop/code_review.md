Thanks for uploading your `java_sources.tar` archive! I‚Äôll extract the contents and review the Java code files inside. Give me a moment to process them.


Your project includes several Java source files and one unit test. Here's a breakdown of the files found:

* **Enums & Constants**: `BreadType.java`, `DrinkSize.java`, `SandwichSize.java`, `ToppingQuality.java`, `ToppingType.java`
* **Classes**: `Chips.java`, `Drink.java`, `Order.java`, `Sandwich.java`, `Topping.java`, `UserInterface.java`
* **Main Program**: `Main.java`
* **Test Class**: `SandwichTest.java`

I'll begin by reviewing the structure and logic of a few key files, starting with `Main.java`, `Order.java`, and `UserInterface.java`, since these likely coordinate the application's flow. Then I‚Äôll look at `Sandwich.java` for object modeling and `SandwichTest.java` for test coverage.

Let me load the contents of these files first.


I've successfully loaded the following files for review:

* `Main.java`
* `UserInterface.java`
* `Order.java`
* `Sandwich.java`
* `SandwichTest.java`

I'll start by reviewing your program's **class design and separation of concerns**, with a focus on:

* Whether UI logic is decoupled from business logic
* If classes follow single responsibility principles
* Proper use of constructors, methods, and encapsulation

Let‚Äôs begin with `Main.java` and `UserInterface.java`.


### ‚úÖ Review: `Main.java` and `UserInterface.java`

#### `Main.java`

This file correctly serves as the program entry point. It delegates interaction to `UserInterface`, which is a **good design choice**. This keeps the `main()` method clean and focused:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UserInterface ui = new UserInterface();
        ui.display();
    }
}
```

**‚úîÔ∏è Feedback:**

* Follows best practices from your course: `main()` is just a launcher.
* Delegation to `UserInterface` promotes clean separation.

#### `UserInterface.java`

This class handles user prompts and coordinates the construction of an `Order` object.

**Observations:**

* It directly calls constructors and mutators on model classes (`Sandwich`, `Drink`, etc.).
* Uses `Scanner` for input, which aligns with workbook examples.
* Contains a long `display()` method, which mixes input gathering with object creation logic.

**üîß Suggestions:**

1. **Refactor for modularity**: Split `display()` into smaller helper methods (e.g., `promptForSandwich()`, `promptForDrink()`, etc.) for better readability and reuse.
2. **Avoid tightly coupling input logic** with business logic:

    * Consider having `UserInterface` collect raw data, and use a separate class to assemble an `Order` (e.g., a factory or builder pattern).

### Next: I‚Äôll review `Order.java` and `Sandwich.java` for data modeling and logic separation.


### ‚úÖ Review: `Order.java` and `Sandwich.java`

---

#### `Order.java`

This class aggregates items that make up an order‚Äî`Sandwich`, `Drink`, `Chips`.

**Observations:**

* Acts as a data container with a `displayOrder()` method that prints details.

**‚úîÔ∏è Positive Notes:**

* Clean and simple structure.
* Uses encapsulation properly with private fields and public getters/setters.

**üîß Suggestions:**

1. **Responsibility Separation**: Move `displayOrder()` output to `UserInterface` or a dedicated presenter/formatter class. `Order` should model data, not manage UI output.
2. **Consider immutability**: If possible, use constructor-based initialization to make `Order` objects immutable once created.

---

#### `Sandwich.java`

This is the most complex data model. It includes:

* Bread type
* Size
* List of toppings
* Pricing logic

**‚úîÔ∏è Strong Points:**

* Follows the course‚Äôs object modeling principles well.
* Encapsulates logic for cost calculation.
* Uses enums and lists properly.

**üîß Suggestions:**

1. **Move cost calculation logic** to a separate `SandwichCalculator` class if it grows, to maintain single responsibility.
2. **Improve cohesion**: Consider grouping related logic (e.g., topping-related methods) into helper methods or classes if it becomes large.

---

Next, I‚Äôll finish with a quick review of your `SandwichTest.java` to check for basic test coverage and best practices.


### ‚úÖ Review: `SandwichTest.java`

This class provides unit testing for the `Sandwich` class using JUnit.

**‚úîÔ∏è Strengths:**

* Good use of assertions to test behavior like cost calculations and topping additions.
* Follows the structure taught in Workbook 4 and Workbook 6 (setup-act-assert style).

**üîß Suggestions:**

1. **Add edge case tests**:

    * What if no toppings are added?
    * What happens with multiple identical toppings?
    * Are invalid topping combinations prevented (if that‚Äôs relevant)?
2. **Test naming**: Use descriptive test method names like `shouldCalculateCorrectCostForLargeSandwichWithTwoToppings()`.

**üõ† IntelliJ Tip**: You can run all tests using **Ctrl+Shift+F10** when your cursor is in the test class or use the green play icon in the left margin. Also try **Alt+Enter** to auto-import or fix issues.

### ‚úÖ Summary of Feedback

You‚Äôve done a great job sticking to the course‚Äôs structure and best practices! Here's a quick recap:

| Area                  | Notes                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Class Design**      | Good separation between UI and data. Could further decouple UI from object creation. |
| **Encapsulation**     | Proper use of private fields, enums, and methods.                                    |
| **Testing**           | Unit test is clean; expand for more coverage.                                        |
| **Improvement Areas** | Modularize long UI methods, separate display logic from model classes.               |

Would you like help refactoring one of the files (like breaking up `UserInterface.display()`), or creating tests for another class?
